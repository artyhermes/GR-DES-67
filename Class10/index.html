        It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Every time you practice, you learn more. Only eight colors
        that you need. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. We'll put a happy little sky in
        here.

        Get tough with it, get strong. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. This piece of
        canvas is your world. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.

        Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day
        long. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.

        And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just
        let it happen. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.

        You're meant to have fun in life. Just let these leaves jump off the brush If we're gonna walk though the woods,
        we need a little path. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. See there how easy
        that is.

        There he comes. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Happy painting, God bless. You can create the world you
        want to see and be a part of. You have that power. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's
        just running through the woods here.
